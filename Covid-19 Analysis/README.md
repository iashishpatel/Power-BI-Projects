# Covid Analysis

**I created dashboard using Tableau that is looking at how the Covid Vaccination program is performing worldwide**

A COVID-19 data analysis dashboard allows users to view and analyze data related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The dashboard typically includes various visualizations and charts that depict key metrics such as the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, as well as other relevant data such as testing rates, hospitalization rates, and vaccine distribution. The dashboard may also include features such as filtering and sorting capabilities, allowing users to view the data in various ways and make comparisons across different regions or time periods. The goal of the project is to provide a user-friendly interface to access and make sense of the data related to the pandemic.
